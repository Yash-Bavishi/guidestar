Algorithm for comment creation
	user needs a user_id (received from JWT) and project_id (recevied from request ?)
	projectMiddleware must also exist
	from project_id it checks for screenshot uri
		if screenshot uri is same as one of the uri in database
			it appends the "context"
		else
			create a new "comment document"
		then fields are setup from request
